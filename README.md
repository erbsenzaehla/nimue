# nimue
A Nice Interface for a better Merlin User Experience
>GUI for the Merlin Speech Synthesis Toolkit<

The nimue folder has to be in the same directory (let's call it A) as the "merlin-master" folder (if your Merlin-directory has a different name, please change data/merlinpath.txt ).

nimue.py must be placed in A to work.
